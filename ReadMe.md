# `mllint` â€” Linter for Machine Learning projects

`mllint` is a command-line utility to evaluate the quality of Machine Learning (ML) projects by means of static analysis of the project's repository. It measures the project's adherence to ML best practices, as collected and deduced from se4ml.github.io and Google's [Rules for ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml).

TODO: find a way to publish this to Pip or something so that users can just pip install it.
